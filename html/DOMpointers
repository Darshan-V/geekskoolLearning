document.getElement -> root node
document.body -> child node
each DOM node has nodeType property -> identifies type of node


#in javascript
firstChild and lastChild properties points to the first and last chile elements or null if no child nodes
previousSibbing and nextSibbling points to the adjacent nodes of the same parent node

###
elements that take up the whole width of the document are called the block elements such as <p>, <h2>
---others such as <a>(links), <strong> are rendered on the same line with their surrounding text are inline elements
 
###
 element attributes can be accessed through a property of the same name on the element's DOM object
---if working on own attributes names, those attributes will not be in the properties of element node so at that case have to use getAttribute and setAttribute
event handlers---- window.addEventListner(action, callback)
-----Webworkers
